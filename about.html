								<div class="inner content">
									<p>For seven years prior to starting a new life in technical writing, in 2010, I was employed in retail and customer service jobs while also working towards finishing college. These humble beginnings provided me with communication skills, which would become essential later, when I entered the professional world. While at George Mason University (GMU) for my BA in English, I not only broadened my vocabulary but also learned about the intricacies of the English language. In fact, during my first interview to become an entry-level technical writer, I explained that my experience with poetry allows me to write effective content in as few words as possible. The very next day, I was offered the job at Paragon Systems, Inc. Though I was in a little over my head for the first year there—the work was a far cry from slinging lattes—I stuck with it and became part of a team that would eventually help win the company over $106M per year in new and re-competed work.</p>

									<p>I eventually left the world of proposal writing, at the end of 2012, to shift my focus more towards user documentation. Since then, I have been serving on a federal government contract serving the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB), where I help create and publish a wide variety of documents, such as procedure manuals, contract policies and guidelines, desk guides, reports, job aids, and administrative forms as well as ensure style consistency across all of the contract's technical documentation.

									<p>In August 2018, I entered into the Professional Writing and Rhetoric (PWR) graduate program at GMU, where I am learning how little I actually knew about technical communication. I love it.</p>

									<p>I originally wanted to became a technical writer because it seemed like a profession where my analytical and creative sides could be put to use and honed at the same time while doing something that helps people. With the successes and experience I've had in my time as a technical writer, I can wholeheartedly say that I chose the right career path.</p>
